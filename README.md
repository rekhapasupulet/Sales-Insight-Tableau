# SALES INSIGHT
## INTRODUCTION

Data plays a very crucial role in todayâ€™s world. The impact on organisations with data is
huge. Businesses run on data and its analytics. Many companies analyse data to improve
their productivity. Many businesses use data analysis to boost their production. Data is
also visualised to help them understand where their business model stands and how it is
performing. Such analysis has the potential to boost a company's revenue. As a result, it
is critical to gather and handle data in accordance with the demands of the organisation
for its own advantage. Without relying on a data scientist, data visualisation allows us to
uncover insights and find patterns inside complex data. Spend less time analysing data by
understanding our next moves. Make judgments quickly. It also disseminates information
in an easy-to-understand format. As the amount of big data grows, more individuals are
turning to data visualisation tools on their computers and mobile devices to gain insights.
Businesspeople, data analysts, and data scientists use dashboards to make data-driven
business decisions.


## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The focus of the project is on a computer hardware company that was having trouble competing 
in a rapidly changing industry. Our project's main goal is to analyse a hardware company's 
revenue and to uncover sales insights that aren't visible to the sales team for decision support. 
Initially, we identified a firm whose sales are currently dropping and decided to analyse the 
company's sales data to determine where the loss is occurring and how the company can cope 
with turning that loss into a profit using data analysis and visualisation. With the help of a 
dashboard, we'll be able to accomplish this. A dashboard is a tool for visualising data. It provides 
insights on one or more pages or screens to assist you keep track of events or activities at a 
glance. Unlike an infographic, which presents a static graphical representation, a dashboard 
conveys real-time information by pulling complex data points directly from large data sets. An 
interactive dashboard makes it easy to sort, filter, or drill into different types of data as needed.
Further Data science techniques can be used to identify what is happening, why it's happening, 
and what will happen next.
